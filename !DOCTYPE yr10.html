  <summary><strong>Week 1: Introduction, Workshop Safety & Constraints</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>In Week 1 of the Mirror unit, we set the stage for a successful project by reviewing essential workshop safety and discussing design constraints. Establishing a <em>safety-first</em> mindset and understanding project limitations (materials, time, tools) will guide all our work.</p>
    <h4>Workshop Safety Refresher</h4>
    <p>Your personal safety and the safety of those around you is paramount. Always wear appropriate PPE (safety glasses, hearing protection, solid footwear) and remain alert to hazards. Key reminders:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always obey <strong>WHS signage</strong> (Warning, Mandatory, Danger, etc.) and workshop rules learned in previous units. These signs use standardised colours and symbols to convey hazards and required actions.</li>
      <li>Never use a machine or tool without permission and proper training (even if you’ve seen it before).</li>
      <li>Keep your workspace tidy to prevent trips or accidents. Clean up spills immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <p>This short video reinforces basic workshop safety rules in an engaging way. Pay attention to the highlighted dos and don’ts.</p>
    <h4>Understanding Design Constraints</h4>
    <p>Besides safety, this week we consider the <strong>constraints and limitations</strong> of our mirror project. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Materials:</strong> We have a set amount of timber and specific dimensions for the mirror frame. Plan your cuts to avoid waste.</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> The project spans 20 weeks. Work steadily and don’t leave tasks to the last minute. Some processes (like glue drying or finish curing) require waiting time.</li>
      <li><strong>Tools & Equipment:</strong> Use only the tools available in our workshop. If your design idea requires a tool we don’t have, you’ll need to adapt.</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Level:</strong> Aim for a challenging yet achievable design. Complex joints or intricate carvings might be exciting, but ensure you can execute them with the skills at hand (or be prepared to learn quickly!).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>On Google Classroom, read the <strong>Workshop Safety & Project Brief</strong> document and complete the Safety quiz.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Week 1 establishes a foundation of safety consciousness and practical awareness of project boundaries. With these principles in mind, you are prepared to begin designing and building your mirror confidently and safely.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week 2: Design & Sketches, Measuring & Marking Out</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Week 2 focuses on the design process and the fundamental skills of measuring and marking out timber accurately. A good design starts with clear sketches, and quality construction begins with precise measurements.</p>
    <h4>Design and Sketching</h4>
    <p>Start by sketching your mirror frame ideas. Consider shape, style, and any decorative elements. Your design sketches should include dimensions and notes. Think about how each piece of the frame joins together. This is also the time to apply <strong>design principles</strong> like balance and proportion, and to ensure your concept meets the project constraints (from Week 1).</p>
    <p>Once you have a draft sketch, draw a more detailed plan (to scale if possible). Label all parts. This drawing will guide your cutting and assembly in later weeks.</p>
    <h4>Measuring and Marking Out</h4>
    <p>Accurate measuring and marking is critical. “Measure twice, cut once” is the golden rule. Key tools for marking out include the tape measure, ruler, try square, and marking gauge. Some tips for precision:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a sharp pencil or marking knife for fine lines. A blunt pencil can lead to a mark that’s 1–2 mm thick, introducing error.</li>
      <li>When using a ruler or tape, keep your eye directly above the measurement to avoid parallax error (misreading from an angle).</li>
      <li>For repeat measurements, use story sticks or templates to ensure consistency rather than measuring afresh each time.</li>
      <li>Mark clearly but lightly on timber; heavy marks can dent softwood or be hard to remove.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aMKPELRhAo" title="Measuring and Marking for Woodworking Projects" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>The video above demonstrates effective measuring and marking techniques with clear instructions suitable for Year 10 students.</p>
    <h4>Safe Use of Tools</h4>
    <p>As you mark and cut timber, always practise tool safety. For example, when using a <strong>tenon saw</strong> or <strong>hand saw</strong>, secure the wood in a vice or with clamps, and keep your free hand clear of the blade path. Use a bench hook for sawing small pieces. For marking with an awl or knife, keep your supporting hand behind the cutting edge. These habits prevent accidents during the basic but essential step of material preparation.</p>
    <p><em>Onguard Safety Modules:</em> This week, continue the OnGuard safety tests focusing on hand tools and measuring tools. Ensure you pass the quizzes for tools like the ruler, try square, and marking gauge.</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>Draft a final sketch of your mirror frame (attach a photo or scan on Classroom) and complete the <strong>Measuring &amp; Marking Quiz</strong> on Google Classroom.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>By combining creative design with precise measuring and marking, you have laid out a roadmap for your project. A well-drawn plan and accurate marks on timber will make the upcoming cutting and joining steps much smoother.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week 3: Dressing Timber to Size & The Hand Plane</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>In Week 3, we move from planning to preparing materials. You will <strong>dress and prepare timber to size</strong> – turning rough stock into the exact dimensions needed for your mirror frame. A key tool this week is the <strong>hand plane</strong>, and we’ll explore its function in detail.</p>
    <h4>Dressing the Timber</h4>
    <p>“Dressing” timber means smoothing and squaring it so that all pieces are true to size. Often, timber as supplied has rough surfaces or slight warps. The process involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cutting to Rough Length:</strong> Using a saw, cut your timber slightly longer than final lengths for the frame sides. This makes handling easier during planing.</li>
      <li><strong>Face and Edge Planning:</strong> Choose one face of the board to be your reference face. Use a jack plane or jointer plane to flatten it. Then plane one adjacent edge at 90° to that face (use a try square to check squareness). These will be your datum surfaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Thicknessing:</strong> Once one face is flat, you can mark the desired thickness on the edges and plane down the opposite face until the board is of uniform thickness. If available, a thicknesser machine can speed this step (instructor will demonstrate machine use, if applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Trimming to Final Dimensions:</strong> After planing, saw or plane the pieces to their exact length and width as per your design measurements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Function of the Hand Plane</h4>
    <p>The hand plane is an essential tool for dressing timber. It works by shaving off thin layers of wood, using a sharp blade set at a fixed depth. Key points about hand planes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>sharp blade (iron)</strong> is critical – a dull blade will tear the wood instead of shaving it, resulting in a rough finish.</li>
      <li>Proper adjustment of the blade is important. For fine smoothing, only a very small portion of the blade should protrude.</li>
      <li>Technique: Plane along the grain whenever possible. Use long, even strokes. Apply pressure on the front knob at the start of the stroke and on the tote (handle) at the end to maintain a level cut.</li>
      <li>Check flatness frequently by sighting down the board or using a straightedge. Mark high spots with pencil and focus planing there.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMSWSriUUWg" title="How to Use a Hand Plane (Ask This Old House)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>The video above demonstrates proper hand plane usage. Notice the stance, grip, and how the craftsman checks the work. Following these methods will help you achieve flat, smooth boards for your frame.</p>
    <h4>Benefits of Accurate Preparation</h4>
    <p>Taking time to dress your timber correctly pays off later. Straight, square pieces ensure that joints fit tightly and the frame comes out square. It also improves the finish quality; for instance, a planed surface often needs less sanding. Remember, any twist or bow in your pieces now will make joinery difficult later.</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>On Classroom, upload a photo of one of your planed boards (showing a smooth surface) and answer the questions in the <strong>Timber Preparation Reflection</strong> form.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>By mastering the hand plane and carefully prepping your timber, you’ve taken a big step toward a quality finished project. Well-prepared materials make the upcoming tasks of cutting joints and assembling the frame much easier and more precise.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week 4: Dowel, Biscuit & Domino Joints; Timber Selection & Properties</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Week 4 dives into <strong>joinery techniques</strong> for connecting pieces of the mirror frame. We’ll compare dowel joints, biscuit joints, and the Festool Domino system – all methods of aligning and strengthening a joint with inserted pieces. Additionally, we’ll discuss how to <strong>select suitable timber</strong> for joinery by understanding timber properties.</p>
    <h4>Dowel, Biscuit, and Domino Joinery</h4>
    <p>These three methods all involve inserting a piece (dowel, biscuit, or domino tenon) to reinforce a joint between two boards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dowel Joints:</strong> Round wooden dowels are inserted into matching drilled holes in the two pieces. This requires precise drilling but creates a strong, hidden connection. Dowel joints typically offer greater strength than biscuits due to the larger wood cross-section and can be used for furniture and frames.</li>
      <li><strong>Biscuit Joints:</strong> Thin oval-shaped biscuits (made of compressed wood) fit into slots cut by a biscuit joiner tool. When glue is applied, the biscuit swells, locking the joint. Biscuits are excellent for aligning pieces (for example, keeping frame corners flush) and are quick and easy to use. They add moderate strength but are generally not as strong as dowels for load-bearing joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Domino Joints:</strong> The Domino system (by Festool) inserts a thick rectangular “loose tenon” (like an oval hardwood block) into slots made by a specialised machine. It essentially combines the concept of a traditional mortise and tenon with the ease of a biscuit joiner. Dominos provide excellent strength (comparable to dowels) and precise alignment, but the tool is expensive and usually only found in advanced workshops. We may not use the Domino in this project, but it’s useful to know about modern joinery innovations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When deciding which to use for a project like a mirror frame:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biscuit joints are often sufficient for aligning the mitred corners of a frame and add some strength along with glue. We have biscuit joiners in our workshop, so this is a likely method for your mirror.</li>
      <li>If you want extra strength or don’t have a biscuit joiner available, dowels can be used in the corners. You must drill very accurately (using a jig helps) to ensure the holes line up.</li>
      <li>We won’t use the Domino in this project (due to tool availability), but understanding it can inspire how you approach joinery in future projects or higher-level classes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a demonstration of using a biscuit joiner (the tool and technique), you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-AT5YRUwDLU" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Dowel vs Biscuit vs Domino – Joinery Comparison</a>. It shows how quickly biscuits can align and join boards.</p>
    <h4>Timber Properties & Selecting Wood for Joinery</h4>
    <p>Not all wood is the same when it comes to making joints. Important timber properties to consider include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hardwood vs Softwood:</strong> Hardwoods (from deciduous trees like oak or maple) are generally denser and hold joinery well, but can be harder to cut. Softwoods (from conifers like pine) are easier to work but can strip or crush in joints if over-tightened. (Note: “Hardwood” and “Softwood” refer to tree type, not necessarily wood hardness – balsa is a hardwood botanically but very soft.) Hardwood trees grow slower and their timber is usually denser and stronger.</li>
      <li><strong>Grain and Stability:</strong> Wood with straight grain and without many knots is ideal for joinery. Knots and wild grain can be weak points or cause a drill or cutter to wander. Straight-grained timber will result in stronger dowel or biscuit joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Moisture Content:</strong> Properly seasoned wood (as we will cover in Week 11) is crucial. Timber that is too wet or not fully dried may shrink or warp after joinery, loosening the joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Timber Strength:</strong> Different species have different strength. For example, using a very soft timber for a dowel might result in the dowel itself breaking under stress before the surrounding wood does. Typically, use the same species for dowels/biscuits as the project wood, or a harder wood for dowels if needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Choosing Wood for Your Mirror:</strong> Our mirror frames will likely be made from <em>pine</em> or similar softwood for affordability and ease. Pine will work fine with either biscuit or dowel joints, but take care not to overtighten clamps as pine can compress. If you have access to some hardwood (like a piece of oak or maple) for contrast or sturdiness, you can incorporate it – just consider that hardwood may require pre-drilling for screws and more patience when cutting.</p>
    <p>For more information on wood types and their characteristics, see <a href="https://dragonfiretools.com/blogs/workbench-wisdom-blog/woodworking-101-a-guide-to-choosing-the-right-type-of-wood" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Woodworking 101: Choosing the Right Type of Wood</a>. It provides examples of common hardwoods and softwoods and their uses.</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>Complete the <strong>Joinery Comparison</strong> worksheet on Classroom (list one advantage and one drawback for dowel, biscuit, and domino joints). Also, in the forum, post which joinery method you plan to use for your mirror frame and why.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Week 4 expands your joinery toolkit and reinforces that choosing the right method and material is key to a strong project. Understanding timber properties helps in selecting good stock for your frame, and knowing multiple joinery options lets you pick what best suits your design and resources. You’re now ready to start creating joints in your mirror frame with confidence.</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 5: Mortise & Tenon Joints (Part 1)</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Mortise and tenon joints are among the most traditional and reliable woodworking joints, often dubbed the “king of joints” for their strength. In Weeks 5 and 6, we will learn how to create a mortise and tenon (M&amp;T) joint and explore variations or alternative joints if applicable. This week (Part 1), we focus on the basics: understanding the joint and cutting the <strong>mortise</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Mortise and Tenon Basics</h4>
    <p>A mortise and tenon joint connects two pieces of wood at a right angle, commonly used in frame construction (like table legs and rails, or in our case, potentially the mirror frame corners if done as bridle joints or reinforced corners). The <strong>mortise</strong> is the rectangular cavity cut into one piece, and the <strong>tenon</strong> is the corresponding tongue cut on the end of the other piece that fits into the mortise.</p>
    <p>Key characteristics of a good M&amp;T joint:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The tenon shoulders (the parts that sit flush against the mortised piece) should fit tightly with no gaps.</li>
      <li>The tenon should fill the mortise with minimal wiggle, but not so tight that it needs to be forced (glue needs a bit of space).</li>
      <li>Mortise depth is usually a bit more than the tenon length so excess glue has somewhere to go (often tenon is about 3-5mm shorter than mortise depth to avoid bottoming out).</li>
      <li>Typically, the mortise width is about one-third the thickness of the workpiece.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Marking and Cutting the Mortise</h4>
    <p>We will cut mortises by hand using drills and chisels (since dedicated mortising machines are limited). Steps to create a mortise:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Layout:</strong> On the piece of wood that will receive the mortise (e.g., a frame stile), clearly mark the outline of the mortise. Use a square and marking gauge to ensure accuracy. For instance, if our frame pieces are 19mm thick, a common mortise might be ~6mm wide (1/3 thickness) and perhaps 30mm deep. Mark the mortise location centred on the thickness and at the appropriate distance from the end (depending on design).</li>
      <li><strong>Drilling (Waste Removal):</strong> Secure the wood. Using a drill press or handheld drill with a brad-point bit of appropriate size (slightly less width than the mortise), drill a series of overlapping holes within the mortise outline. Drill to the required depth. This removes most of the waste wood.</li>
      <li><strong>Chiselling:</strong> Use sharp bench chisels to square up the mortise. Start by chiselling along the ends (the cross-grain sides) of the mortise to define the edges, then work from each end toward the middle to remove remaining waste. Keep the chisel vertical and use a mallet for controlled force. Periodically test the depth and clean out chips. The result should be straight, flat mortise walls.</li>
      <li><strong>Test Fit (with scrap tenon):</strong> If possible, have a scrap piece cut to the mortise width to test the fit. It should slide in with hand pressure and not wobble side-to-side.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note:</em> Precision is crucial. A mortise that is too narrow can be widened with careful paring, but one that’s too wide will make the joint sloppy. Take your time with layout and chiselling.</p>
    <h4>Tools and Safety for Mortising</h4>
    <p>While chopping a mortise, always keep hands behind the chisel cutting edge. Secure your workpiece with clamps or in a vice – never hold the piece in your hand while chiselling. If using a drill, clamp the wood to prevent it spinning if the bit catches. Wear safety glasses especially during chiselling; small wood chips can fly off.</p>
    <p>We are using sharp chisels; handle them with respect. When not in use, set them down with the sharp edge away from you and others.</p>
    <h4>Alternative Joint Consideration</h4>
    <p>If a traditional mortise and tenon seems too challenging or not suitable for your mirror frame corners, an <strong>alternative joint</strong> that might be used is a <strong>bridle joint</strong> (open mortise and tenon) or a reinforced miter (with a spline). We will primarily practise M&amp;T because it teaches transferable skills. However, keep in mind these alternatives for different project needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bridle Joint:</strong> Essentially a tenon that goes through the end of the piece (open on top), like an open mortise. Easier to cut than a hidden mortise and tenon and useful for frame corners.</li>
      <li><strong>Spline or Biscuit Reinforced Miter:</strong> As learnt, a biscuit or thin spline can reinforce a miter joint on a frame if M&amp;T is not used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>In your workbook (or Classroom assignment), answer the questions in <strong>Mortise &amp; Tenon Part 1</strong>: Describe the steps to cut a mortise, and explain why the mortise is cut before the tenon in fitting this joint.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>By the end of Week 5, you should have one or more mortises cut for a sample joint and a solid understanding of how and why mortise dimensions are chosen. Mastery of the mortise forms the foundation; next week, we will tackle crafting the matching tenon and assembling the joint.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week 6: Mortise &amp; Tenon Joints (Part 2) and Other Frame Joints</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Continuing from Week 5, Week 6 will cover cutting the <strong>tenon</strong> to fit our mortise and assembling the mortise and tenon joint. We will also discuss any other joint types relevant to frame construction (for example, if someone is using a different joint for their mirror corners, such as half-lap joints, we’ll address that). By the end of this week, you should have a completed sample M&amp;T joint and be ready to apply these skills to your project if needed.</p>
    <h4>Cutting the Tenon</h4>
    <p>With your mortise ready, the next step is to cut the tenon on the mating piece. Steps to cut an accurate tenon:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Using a marking gauge and square, mark the tenon thickness on the end of the piece (this should match the mortise width). Also mark the shoulders – how far back the tenon extends. For example, if the mirror frame joint is at the corner, you might have a tenon that is, say, 40mm long into a stile. Mark the tenon length slightly shorter than the mortise depth (about 2-3mm shorter to avoid bottoming out).</li>
      <li><strong>Saw the Cheeks:</strong> The “cheeks” are the faces of the tenon. Use a tenon saw (or bandsaw if available) to cut down along the waste sides of the tenon cheeks, just inside the lines, from the end of the piece to the shoulder line. It’s often best to cut the two cheek cuts with the wood held vertically and the saw cutting straight down.</li>
      <li><strong>Saw the Shoulders:</strong> Lay the piece flat and saw along the shoulder lines to meet the cheek cuts. The waste pieces should fall away, leaving the tenon. Make sure to keep the saw kerf on the waste side of the line to preserve the full width of the tenon.</li>
      <li><strong>Trim &amp; Fit:</strong> Test the tenon in the mortise. If it’s too tight, use a sharp chisel or a shoulder plane to pare down the cheeks gently until it slides in with firm pressure. If it’s too loose (hopefully not), options include shimming it or re-cutting on a new piece if it’s excessively sloppy. Aim for a fit where the tenon can be inserted by hand and pulled out by hand, but without much wobble.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Tip:</em> When test fitting, don’t force the tenon all the way in if it’s very snug and dry – you might get it stuck. It should go in most of the way with hand pressure. Remember, glue will lubricate a tight joint slightly during assembly, but you don’t want to rely on that too much.</p>
    <h4>Reinforcing and Assembling</h4>
    <p>For our sample joints or if you incorporate an M&amp;T in your mirror, consider how it will be secured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Usually, woodworking glue alone is sufficient for a well-fitted M&amp;T, creating a bond stronger than the wood itself.</li>
      <li>In high-stress applications, a peg or dowel is sometimes driven through the joint (a <strong>drawbore peg</strong>) after gluing for additional mechanical lock. For the mirror frame, this is likely unnecessary and would alter the appearance.</li>
      <li>Clamp the joint snugly during glue-up, ensuring the shoulder seats fully with no gap. Wipe off excess glue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will assemble our practice M&amp;T joints in class to observe how everything comes together. Make sure to have clamps ready and protect the wood surface with scrap blocks under the clamp jaws.</p>
    <h4>Other Frame Joint Options</h4>
    <p>Not all mirror frames will use a mortise and tenon. Here are a couple of other joint methods some of you might be using (or might consider):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Half-Lap Joint:</strong> A simple but strong corner joint where half the thickness of each piece is removed at the end so they lap over each other. This increases glue surface and keeps the frame flush. It’s simpler to cut than a mortise and tenon and can be done with saws and chisels or even a router. If anyone is pursuing a half-lap for their mirror frame, ensure the two halves fit flush and tight.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitre Joint with Splines/Biscuits:</strong> Many mirror frames are just mitred at 45° on the corners for a clean look. On its own, a plain miter isn’t very strong for a wooden frame, so reinforcement like a glued spline (a thin strip inserted in slots across the joint) or biscuits can help. We covered biscuit joints in Week 4 – those can be applied to mitred corners too.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>Complete the <strong>M&amp;T Joint Quiz</strong> on Classroom (covering terminology like “cheeks” and “shoulders” and best practices for fitting). If you made a sample M&amp;T joint, upload a photo and brief note about how it went.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>By completing the mortise and tenon joint, you’ve practised one of the most important woodworking joints. Even if your mirror frame won’t explicitly use a hidden M&amp;T, the skills of careful measuring, cutting, and fitting apply to all joinery. Week 6 wraps up our intensive focus on joinery techniques – from here, we’ll start adding creative features and moving toward finishing the project.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week 7: Router Use &amp; Safety; Timber Types and Features</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Week 7 splits focus between machine tool skills and material knowledge. In the practical sessions, you will see a demonstration of the <strong>router</strong> – a versatile power tool – including safe operating procedures (SOP). The theory portion will explore different <strong>timber types and their features</strong>, reinforcing some concepts from Week 4 and expanding on how timber is classified and behaves.</p>
    <h4>Router Demonstration and Safety (OnGuard SOP)</h4>
    <p>The router is a high-speed power tool used to hollow out wood or profile edges. In our mirror project, a router might be used to cut the rebate (groove) in the back of the frame where the mirror glass will sit, or to add a decorative edge profile on the front of the frame.</p>
    <p><strong>Router Basics:</strong> A router holds a bit (cutter) that spins at very high RPM. By guiding the router along the wood or guiding wood against a router table, you can create precise cuts. Common router bits you might see include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Straight bit:</strong> for cutting grooves or rebates (good for the mirror glass recess).</li>
      <li><strong>Round-over bit:</strong> adds a rounded edge to soften corners – often used on frame edges for a smooth look.</li>
      <li><strong>Flush trim bit:</strong> has a bearing to ride along a template or edge, trimming another piece exactly flush (useful if using a pattern to cut shapes).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Router Safety SOP Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always secure your workpiece. If using a handheld router, clamp the wood. If using a router table, ensure guards and fences are set correctly.</li>
      <li>Check that the bit is tight in the collet (router’s chuck) and that the cutting path is clear of any nails or screws in the wood.</li>
      <li>Wear safety glasses and hearing protection – routers are loud and can throw chips at high speed.</li>
      <li>Keep hands a safe distance from the bit. Use push blocks or jigs to keep control especially on a router table.</li>
      <li>Wait for the router to fully stop before setting it down or removing any off-cuts. Unplug (or switch off at the wall for a table) before changing bits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The OnGuard test for the router will cover these points and more. Pay attention during the demo; you will need to demonstrate safe router operation for assessment.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The video above provides a beginner-friendly overview of using a router, including edge profiling and safety tips. It’s a great supplement to the live demonstration.</p>
    <h4>Timber Types &amp; Features</h4>
    <p>Earlier we discussed hardwoods vs softwoods. Let’s summarise and add some more features of timber to consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hardwoods vs Softwoods:</strong> As a review, hardwoods come from broad-leaf trees (often deciduous), softwoods from conifers. Hardwoods (like jarrah, oak, walnut) tend to have complex grain and are often denser; softwoods (like pine, cedar) are usually lighter and grow faster. We use plenty of pine in class due to its availability and workability.</li>
      <li><strong>Grain Patterns:</strong> The way a board is cut from a log (timber conversion method) affects grain pattern. For example, quarter-sawn timber shows straight grain lines and is less prone to warping, while plain-sawn (through-sawn) timber may show a “cathedral” grain pattern and can cup more. (We’ll cover conversion in detail in Week 9.)</li>
      <li><strong>Knots and Defects:</strong> A quick recap: knots are where branches grew and can be hard but also can fall out or crack; resin pockets, gum veins, or other defects can affect strength. Select pieces that avoid large defects for critical parts of your project.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Durability:</strong> Some woods contain oils or tannins that resist rot and pests (e.g., cedar, teak). While this is more relevant for outdoor projects, it’s good to know. For an indoor project like a mirror, durability is more about hardness (resisting dings) and stability (not warping over time).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our timber for the mirror frames is likely Radiata Pine. Its features: light yellow, soft, with relatively straight grain but plenty of knots. It’s easy to cut and plane but be careful of tear-out around knots and the softness (dents easily). Handle it gently when clamping and use scrap blocks to prevent clamp marks.</p>
    <p>If you have chosen to use any different wood for decorative effect (perhaps a strip of a darker hardwood inlay), research that wood’s features so you know how it might behave differently (for example, Tasmanian oak is harder and will need slower cutting, etc.).</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>After the router demo, complete the <strong>Router Safety Checklist</strong> quiz on Classroom. For timber types, find one interesting fact about a specific wood species you might like to use in future projects and post it in the discussion (e.g., “Jarrah is termite-resistant” or “Cedar has natural oils that smell pleasant and repel moths”).</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Week 7 blends practical tool use with deeper material understanding. You’ve gained exposure to the router – an important tool for adding professional touches to your work – and you’ve strengthened your knowledge of timber, the very material we craft. Both aspects will help you make better decisions in the coming stages of building and finishing your mirror frame.</p>

<!-- Week 8 in Mirror Theory -->
<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 8: Dry Fitting &amp; Clamping; Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>At Week 8, many of your mirror frame components should be cut and ready. This week’s focus is on <strong>dry fitting and clamping</strong> your frame and understanding the importance of planning out assembly steps. We’ll also introduce how to document safety for processes by using <strong>Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)</strong> and review any relevant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for tasks at hand.</p>
    <h4>Dry Fitting and Clamping Techniques</h4>
    <p><strong>Dry fitting</strong> means assembling your project <em>without glue</em> to check that everything fits correctly. You should always do this before the actual glue-up, especially for multi-component assemblies like a frame with multiple joints.</p>
    <p>When dry fitting your mirror frame:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assemble the pieces on a flat surface. If you’ve used biscuits or dowels, insert them without glue to ensure alignment.</li>
      <li>Check that the frame is square. Measure the diagonals – they should be equal if the frame is rectangular and corners are 90°.</li>
      <li>Identify any gaps in joints or unevenness. If something isn’t fitting, now is the time to adjust (trim a tenon, deepen a mortise, etc.) before gluing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Clamping:</strong> Once satisfied with the dry fit, plan your clamping strategy for the glue-up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have the right number and size of clamps ready. For a rectangular frame, typically you’d use a clamp on each side or use strap clamps that wrap around the frame corners.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>cauls</strong> or scrap wood pads between the clamp jaws and your frame to protect the wood and distribute pressure. This prevents denting the timber, especially soft pine.</li>
      <li>Tighten clamps evenly. Alternate turns on opposite clamps so the frame closes up uniformly. Over-tightening can squeeze out too much glue or even bow the wood; aim for firm pressure that closes any gaps.</li>
      <li>Verify squareness after clamping – it’s easy for a frame to shift when clamps are applied. Adjust the clamps or use a diagonal brace if needed to keep things square.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’re not ready to glue your actual mirror frame this week, you might practise clamping on a dry fit and even do a “mock glue-up” drill for confidence. Proper clamping is crucial for a sturdy, well-aligned final product.</p>
    <h4>Work Method Statements (SWMS)</h4>
    <p>A <strong>Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)</strong> is a document used to outline how to carry out work safely. It’s often required in industry for high-risk construction tasks, but we introduce it here as a good practice for planning safe project work. An SWMS typically includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A description of the activity or task (e.g., “Assembling mirror frame with glue and clamps”).</li>
      <li>Identification of potential hazards (e.g., “skin contact with glue”, “pinched fingers in clamps”, “tripping over clamps on floor”).</li>
      <li>Risk control measures for those hazards (e.g., “wear gloves to avoid glue on skin”, “ensure clamps are secure and use proper technique to avoid pinch”, “keep work area clear”).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In formal terms, an SWMS is a safety planning document, required especially for high-risk work. For our class, writing a brief SWMS for a process like gluing up the frame helps you think ahead about safety and efficiency. It’s like a written version of asking “What could go wrong here, and how do I prevent it?”.</p>
    <p><strong>Our Task:</strong> We will fill out a simplified SWMS for the mirror frame assembly. This will cover setting up clamps, using glue safely (not ingesting, cleaning spills, etc.), and any use of tools during assembly. You’ll do this in small groups so you can brainstorm hazards and controls together.</p>
    <h4>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</h4>
    <p>By now, you have encountered various SOPs (for machines like the band saw, disc sander, router, etc.). Ensure that for any task you do this week, you revisit the relevant SOP. For example, if you use the disc sander to slightly adjust a piece, remember to follow the Disc Sander SOP (tie back hair, use the correct side of the disc, etc.). Our goal is to maintain safety standards even as the project work becomes more complex.</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>On Classroom, find the <strong>SWMS Template (Frame Assembly)</strong> and fill it out for the mirror frame glue-up process, either individually or with your team. Also, complete the short reflection: “What was one issue you caught during dry fitting that you fixed before gluing?”</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Week 8 is about foresight and planning – both in assembling your work correctly and in ensuring safety. By dry clamping your project, you ensure a smooth final assembly with no surprises. By writing an SWMS and adhering to SOPs, you cultivate a proactive safety habit that is valuable not just in class but in any workplace or project environment.</p>

<!-- Week 9 in Mirror Theory -->
<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 9: Adding Design Features &amp; Timber Conversion</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>With the basic structure of the mirror frame taking shape, Week 9 allows some creativity: <strong>adding design features</strong> to personalise and enhance your project. This could include decorative cuts, patterns, or other aesthetic touches. Alongside this practical work, the theory discussion covers <strong>Timber Conversion</strong> – how logs are sawn into timber – which influences the material we work with.</p>
    <h4>Design Features for Your Mirror</h4>
    <p>Design features might be things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Edge Profiles:</strong> Using the router (from Week 7) to put a beveled or rounded edge on the frame. For example, a chamfer along the inner edge of the frame can elegantly highlight the transition to the mirror glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Carvings or Engravings:</strong> Simple carvings, patterns, or even woodburning (pyrography) on the frame surface. Plan these out on paper first. If using the laser cutter (as demonstrated in the breadboard project), you could engrave a motif onto the frame – coordinate with the teacher for laser access.</li>
      <li><strong>Inlays:</strong> Embedding a contrasting piece of wood or material into a groove or cavity. This is advanced, but something like a thin strip of darker wood inlaid near the frame edges can be striking.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware or Embellishments:</strong> Perhaps adding decorative brackets at corners or metal hooks/pegs if this mirror will also serve as a hanging rack, etc. (Be sure any additions are planned so they don’t interfere with function or glass installation.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Workshop Maintenance Note</h4>
    <p>As you do creative work, don’t forget to maintain a clean workspace. Design cut-offs, wood shavings, etc., should be cleared. Especially if multiple people are experimenting with designs, tools and benches can get cluttered – keep up the good practise of cleanup to avoid accidents or lost pieces.</p>
    <h4>Timber Conversion: From Logs to Lumber</h4>
    <p>Now let’s switch to theory: understanding how the timber we use is produced from logs. <strong>Timber conversion</strong> refers to the process of sawing logs into planks and boards. The method of conversion affects the wood’s grain and stability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Through and Through (Plain Sawing):</strong> The log is sliced straight through repeatedly to make boards. This is the most economical method and produces boards quickly with minimal repositioning of the log. It results in a mix of grain orientations – some boards will have near-vertical grain (toward the centre of the log), others will have wide arcs (near the outer parts). Plain-sawn boards often have a distinctive “cathedral” grain pattern on the face. They tend to be prone to <em>cupping</em> as they season, because of growth ring curvature. However, this method yields maximum wood with least waste and is commonly used for construction lumber.</li>
      <li><strong>Quarter Sawing:</strong> The log is first cut into quarters, and then boards are sawn from each quarter at angles. This method yields boards where growth rings are more perpendicular to the face. Quarter-sawn boards have a straighter grain appearance and often show attractive figuring (like oak’s “flecks”). They are more dimensionally stable (less warping, less expansion and contraction across the width). The downside is quarter sawing is time-consuming, wasteful of material, and thus more expensive.</li>
      <li><strong>Rift Sawing:</strong> A variation aiming for very vertical grain in each board. It yields very consistent (but more narrow) boards, often used in fine furniture for uniform grain. This wastes even more wood than quarter sawing and is rarely done except for speciality needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most wood you buy will be plain-sawn unless it’s specifically advertised as quarter-sawn. For example, our pine boards likely come from through-and-through sawing. You might notice the grain patterns and any cupping or bowing in them – now you know why those characteristics occur.</p>
    <p>Why does this matter? As a woodworker, if you know a board is cut a certain way, you can predict how it will behave. Quarter-sawn pieces for frame parts might resist warping better over years. Plain-sawn pieces might need extra care in finishing to seal them to reduce moisture changes. It also explains cost differences: quarter-sawn timber, being more labour-intensive and with more waste, costs more.</p>
    <p>For an interactive look at sawmill cutting, watch the video below which shows how a modern mill converts logs to lumber and the decisions made to maximise quality:</p>

    </div>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>1) Describe one design feature you plan to add to your mirror (and why) in the Classroom discussion <strong>"My Mirror's Unique Feature"</strong>. 2) Complete the quiz on timber conversion methods – referring to which method yields the most stable boards and which yields the most lumber per log.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Week 9 balances art and science: you enhance your mirror with creative touches that reflect your personal style, while also learning the scientific/logistical side of how wood gets from forest to workshop. Recognising how timber is converted enriches your appreciation for the material and can influence how you select and use wood in this and future projects.</p>

<!-- Week 10 in Mirror Theory -->
<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 10: Finishing Design Elements &amp; Workshop Maintenance</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>By Week 10, we are roughly at the half-way point of our project timeline. This week is about wrapping up any remaining <strong>design elements</strong> on your mirror frame and ensuring the workshop and tools are well-maintained for the next stages. Think of it as a checkpoint: finish all modifications before moving into the finishing (sanding, painting/oiling) phase, and do some mid-project <strong>workshop maintenance</strong> to keep our environment safe and efficient.</p>
    <h4>Complete Your Design Features</h4>
    <p>Take this time to finalise any decorative work on your mirror frame:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you planned a pattern or carving and haven’t done it yet, do it now. Once we begin sanding and finishing, adding new cuts or carvings will mean re-sanding/re-finishing those areas, which is less efficient.</li>
      <li>Double-check symmetry and consistency. For instance, if you routed an edge profile on one part of the frame last week, ensure all corresponding parts get the same treatment now so the frame looks uniform.</li>
      <li>Sand any rough edges around decorative cuts. Use small files or sandpaper on a block to smooth out carved details without losing the definition.</li>
      <li>Test-fit the mirror glass (without permanently fixing it) if your frame is assembled. It should fit into the rebate or opening comfortably. If not, carefully adjust the opening size now (lightly trim with a chisel or sand the inside edges) rather than forcing the glass later.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Perform a thorough <strong>quality check</strong> on your woodworking: all joints are secure (if something is still unglued, plan to glue it soon), all design features done, no cracks or split pieces (if something cracked, consult on how to fix or replace that piece now).</p>
    <h4>Workshop Maintenance</h4>
    <p>A clean and well-maintained workshop ensures the second half of our project goes smoothly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tool Maintenance:</strong> Are the hand tools and power tools in good shape? This is a good time to sharpen chisels or plane irons (dull tools can cause accidents and poor work). The instructor may demonstrate quick sharpening techniques. If the router bit used last week has resin buildup, it should be cleaned. Any tool you noticed acting “off” – mention it, we can adjust or sharpen it.</li>
      <li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> Remove clutter from benches. Sweep or vacuum dust and wood chips from machines and floor. Piles of sawdust are not only a fire hazard but can also affect the quality of finishing.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Stack or store your project pieces safely. Have a designated area where they lie flat or stand securely. Keep your mirror glass stored safely to avoid damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Check consumables – are we low on sandpaper, glue, or finishing supplies? This helps plan for the next term.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This maintenance session echoes what happens in industry: regular cleanup and tool upkeep improves safety and work quality. It’s easier to do great work in a tidy shop.</p>
    <h4>Safety Focus: Mid-project</h4>
    <p>It’s worth noting: sometimes when projects progress, people get comfortable and might slip on safety habits (e.g., forgetting glasses when sanding). Don’t let that happen. As we gear up for finishing, ensure all safety equipment is ready and commit to safe practices.</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>No quiz this week – instead, complete the “Workshop Maintenance Checklist” on Classroom and mark each item as completed. Optionally, share a before-and-after photo of your workbench cleanup.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>By finishing all creative woodwork this week, you ensure that the rest of the project can focus on the final finish. A well-organised and maintained workshop sets us up for success in the finishing stage.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week 11: Frame Assembly & Timber Seasoning</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>In Week 11, the mirror frame should come together fully. If not already done, this week is for the final <strong>assembly/gluing</strong> of the mirror frame and ensuring it’s structurally complete. While the glue dries, we will learn about <strong>Timber Seasoning</strong> – the process of drying wood – and why it’s important for our projects.</p>
    <h4>Final Assembly / Gluing the Frame</h4>
    <p>By now, you have dry-fitted and know your frame pieces fit. Now it’s time for the real glue-up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather all needed items before applying glue: clamps (with pads), glue bottle, a small brush, a damp rag, a square, and clamp blocks/cauls.</li>
      <li>Apply an even layer of wood glue to all joint surfaces that will mate. Use just enough glue for a continuous film.</li>
      <li>Assemble the frame promptly. If using biscuits or dowels, insert them before the glue skins over.</li>
      <li>Clamp the frame gently at first, then tighten gradually while checking alignment and squareness.</li>
      <li>Immediately wipe off excess glue with a damp rag.</li>
      <li>Ensure the frame is flat and square, then leave clamped until the glue cures.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Timber Seasoning</h4>
    <p>Fresh-cut wood (green wood) is not used directly for furniture because it must be <strong>seasoned</strong> – dried to an appropriate moisture content. Key points about seasoning include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reduces moisture to a stable level (usually 8-12% for indoor furniture) to prevent warping or shrinking.</li>
      <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Wood can be air-dried (stacked with spacers) or kiln-dried (using controlled heat and airflow).</li>
      <li><strong>Signs of Unseasoned Wood:</strong> Warping, cracking, or end checking.</li>
      <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Our project wood is pre-seasoned, but understanding the process is essential for future projects.</li>
    </ul>

  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>With assembled frames in hand, Week 12 is all about preparing the surface for finishing. This includes thorough <strong>sanding</strong> and any last touch-ups. We also revisit <strong>milling timber</strong> – preparing raw lumber for use in your project.</p>
    <h4>Sanding and Surface Preparation</h4>
    <p>Before any finish goes on, the wood must be properly sanded and clean. Follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with Medium Grit:</strong> Use 120 grit to smooth tool marks and minor imperfections.</li>
      <li><strong>Progress to Finer Grits:</strong> Move to 180 then 240 grit for a smooth finish. Always sand with the grain.</li>
      <li><strong>Detail Work:</strong> Use a sanding block for corners and routed profiles to maintain shape.</li>
      <li><strong>End Grain:</strong> Sand end grain extra carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Clean:</strong> Remove all dust with a vacuum or tack cloth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Milling Timber in the Workshop</h4>
    <p>Industrial milling involves:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Jointing:</strong> Flatten one face and straighten an edge.</li>
      <li><strong>Planing/Thicknessing:</strong> Achieve uniform thickness with a planer.</li>
      <li><strong>Rip and Crosscut:</strong> Cut the board to width and length.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This sequence ensures each piece is square and true, making assembly easier.</p>
    <h4>Safety and Cleanliness During Sanding</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Wear a dust mask or respirator.</li>
      <li>Ensure proper ventilation.</li>
      <li>Secure small pieces when using power sanders.</li>

  <summary><strong>Week 15: Chemical Safety & MSDS in Finishing</strong></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Week 15 is a lighter practical week as your project should be nearly complete. It focuses on the theory of safe handling of chemicals in the workshop, particularly those used in finishing (paints, thinners, adhesives). We will learn about Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) – now often called SDS – which provide key safety information about chemicals.</p>
    <h4>Workshop Chemicals in Use</h4>
    <p>Common chemicals include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wood Finishes:</strong> Often contain solvents like mineral turpentine, naphtha, or alcohol. These are flammable and can be hazardous if inhaled.</li>
      <li><strong>Adhesives:</strong> PVA glue is relatively safe, but other adhesives like epoxy can be more hazardous.</li>
      <li><strong>Strippers and Cleaners:</strong> Citrus-based alternatives are safer than older, toxic formulas.</li>
      <li><strong>Spray Paints:</strong> Contain propellants and solvents; use with proper ventilation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Understanding MSDS/SDS</h4>
    <p>An MSDS is a document that details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product identification and hazards.</li>
      <li>Composition and first aid measures.</li>
      <li>Firefighting and spill cleanup instructions.</li>
      <li>Handling, storage, exposure controls, and disposal guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, an MSDS for an oil-based polyurethane will warn about flammability and advise wearing gloves and eye protection.</p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>This week, find and interpret a real MSDS. Use the provided worksheet on Classroom to answer questions about recommended PPE, storage, and first aid measures.</p>
    <p><a href="https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ5MDQxMzk4MjAz" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Go to Google Classroom</a></p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Understanding MSDS information is crucial for safely handling chemicals in the workshop. This knowledge is essential whether you pursue woodworking as a hobby or a career.</p>
