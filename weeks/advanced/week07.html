<summary><strong>Week 7: Router Use &amp; Safety; Timber Types and Features</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 7 splits focus between machine tool skills and material knowledge. In the practical sessions, you will see a demonstration of the <strong>router</strong> – a versatile power tool – including safe operating procedures (SOP). The theory portion will explore different <strong>timber types and their features</strong>, reinforcing some concepts from Week 4 and expanding on how timber is classified and behaves.</p>
<h4>Router Demonstration and Safety (OnGuard SOP)</h4>
<p>The router is a high-speed power tool used to hollow out wood or profile edges. In our mirror project, a router might be used to cut the rebate (groove) in the back of the frame where the mirror glass will sit, or to add a decorative edge profile on the front of the frame.</p>
<p><strong>Router Basics:</strong> A router holds a bit (cutter) that spins at very high RPM. By guiding the router along the wood or guiding wood against a router table, you can create precise cuts. Common router bits you might see include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Straight bit:</strong> for cutting grooves or rebates (good for the mirror glass recess).</li>
<li><strong>Round-over bit:</strong> adds a rounded edge to soften corners – often used on frame edges for a smooth look.</li>
<li><strong>Flush trim bit:</strong> has a bearing to ride along a template or edge, trimming another piece exactly flush (useful if using a pattern to cut shapes).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Router Safety SOP Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always secure your workpiece. If using a handheld router, clamp the wood. If using a router table, ensure guards and fences are set correctly.</li>
<li>Check that the bit is tight in the collet (router’s chuck) and that the cutting path is clear of any nails or screws in the wood.</li>
<li>Wear safety glasses and hearing protection – routers are loud and can throw chips at high speed.</li>
<li>Keep hands a safe distance from the bit. Use push blocks or jigs to keep control especially on a router table.</li>
<li>Wait for the router to fully stop before setting it down or removing any off-cuts. Unplug (or switch off at the wall for a table) before changing bits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OnGuard test for the router will cover these points and more. Pay attention during the demo; you will need to demonstrate safe router operation for assessment.</p>

<p>The video above provides a beginner-friendly overview of using a router, including edge profiling and safety tips. It’s a great supplement to the live demonstration.</p>
<h4>Timber Types &amp; Features</h4>
<p>Earlier we discussed hardwoods vs softwoods. Let’s summarise and add some more features of timber to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardwoods vs Softwoods:</strong> As a review, hardwoods come from broad-leaf trees (often deciduous), softwoods from conifers. Hardwoods (like jarrah, oak, walnut) tend to have complex grain and are often denser; softwoods (like pine, cedar) are usually lighter and grow faster. We use plenty of pine in class due to its availability and workability.</li>
<li><strong>Grain Patterns:</strong> The way a board is cut from a log (timber conversion method) affects grain pattern. For example, quarter-sawn timber shows straight grain lines and is less prone to warping, while plain-sawn (through-sawn) timber may show a “cathedral” grain pattern and can cup more. (We’ll cover conversion in detail in Week 9.)</li>
<li><strong>Knots and Defects:</strong> A quick recap: knots are where branches grew and can be hard but also can fall out or crack; resin pockets, gum veins, or other defects can affect strength. Select pieces that avoid large defects for critical parts of your project.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Durability:</strong> Some woods contain oils or tannins that resist rot and pests (e.g., cedar, teak). While this is more relevant for outdoor projects, it’s good to know. For an indoor project like a mirror, durability is more about hardness (resisting dings) and stability (not warping over time).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our timber for the mirror frames is likely Radiata Pine. Its features: light yellow, soft, with relatively straight grain but plenty of knots. It’s easy to cut and plane but be careful of tear-out around knots and the softness (dents easily). Handle it gently when clamping and use scrap blocks to prevent clamp marks.</p>
<p>If you have chosen to use any different wood for decorative effect (perhaps a strip of a darker hardwood inlay), research that wood’s features so you know how it might behave differently (for example, Tasmanian oak is harder and will need slower cutting, etc.).</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>After the router demo, complete the <strong>Router Safety Checklist</strong> quiz on Classroom. For timber types, find one interesting fact about a specific wood species you might like to use in future projects and post it in the discussion (e.g., “Jarrah is termite-resistant” or “Cedar has natural oils that smell pleasant and repel moths”).</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 7 blends practical tool use with deeper material understanding. You’ve gained exposure to the router – an important tool for adding professional touches to your work – and you’ve strengthened your knowledge of timber, the very material we craft. Both aspects will help you make better decisions in the coming stages of building and finishing your mirror frame.</p>
