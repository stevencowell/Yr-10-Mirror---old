<summary><strong>Week 9: Adding Design Features &amp; Timber Conversion</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>With the basic structure of the mirror frame taking shape, Week 9 allows some creativity: <strong>adding design features</strong> to personalise and enhance your project. This could include decorative cuts, patterns, or other aesthetic touches. Alongside this practical work, the theory discussion covers <strong>Timber Conversion</strong> ‚Äì how logs are sawn into timber ‚Äì which influences the material we work with.</p>
<h4>Design Features for Your Mirror</h4>
<p>Design features might be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge Profiles:</strong> Using the router (from Week 7) to put a beveled or rounded edge on the frame. For example, a chamfer along the inner edge of the frame can elegantly highlight the transition to the mirror glass.</li>
<li><strong>Carvings or Engravings:</strong> Simple carvings, patterns, or even woodburning (pyrography) on the frame surface. Plan these out on paper first. If using the laser cutter (as demonstrated in the breadboard project), you could engrave a motif onto the frame ‚Äì coordinate with the teacher for laser access.</li>
<li><strong>Inlays:</strong> Embedding a contrasting piece of wood or material into a groove or cavity. This is advanced, but something like a thin strip of darker wood inlaid near the frame edges can be striking.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware or Embellishments:</strong> Perhaps adding decorative brackets at corners or metal hooks/pegs if this mirror will also serve as a hanging rack, etc. (Be sure any additions are planned so they don‚Äôt interfere with function or glass installation.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Workshop Maintenance Note</h4>
<p>As you do creative work, don‚Äôt forget to maintain a clean workspace. Design cut-offs, wood shavings, etc., should be cleared. Especially if multiple people are experimenting with designs, tools and benches can get cluttered ‚Äì keep up the good practise of cleanup to avoid accidents or lost pieces.</p>
<h4>Timber Conversion: From Logs to Lumber</h4>
<p>Now let‚Äôs switch to theory: understanding how the timber we use is produced from logs. <strong>Timber conversion</strong> refers to the process of sawing logs into planks and boards. The method of conversion affects the wood‚Äôs grain and stability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Through and Through (Plain Sawing):</strong> The log is sliced straight through repeatedly to make boards. This is the most economical method and produces boards quickly with minimal repositioning of the log. It results in a mix of grain orientations ‚Äì some boards will have near-vertical grain (toward the centre of the log), others will have wide arcs (near the outer parts). Plain-sawn boards often have a distinctive ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù grain pattern on the face. They tend to be prone to <em>cupping</em> as they season, because of growth ring curvature. However, this method yields maximum wood with least waste and is commonly used for construction lumber.</li>
<li><strong>Quarter Sawing:</strong> The log is first cut into quarters, and then boards are sawn from each quarter at angles. This method yields boards where growth rings are more perpendicular to the face. Quarter-sawn boards have a straighter grain appearance and often show attractive figuring (like oak‚Äôs ‚Äúflecks‚Äù). They are more dimensionally stable (less warping, less expansion and contraction across the width). The downside is quarter sawing is time-consuming, wasteful of material, and thus more expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Rift Sawing:</strong> A variation aiming for very vertical grain in each board. It yields very consistent (but more narrow) boards, often used in fine furniture for uniform grain. This wastes even more wood than quarter sawing and is rarely done except for speciality needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most wood you buy will be plain-sawn unless it‚Äôs specifically advertised as quarter-sawn. For example, our pine boards likely come from through-and-through sawing. You might notice the grain patterns and any cupping or bowing in them ‚Äì now you know why those characteristics occur.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? As a woodworker, if you know a board is cut a certain way, you can predict how it will behave. Quarter-sawn pieces for frame parts might resist warping better over years. Plain-sawn pieces might need extra care in finishing to seal them to reduce moisture changes. It also explains cost differences: quarter-sawn timber, being more labour-intensive and with more waste, costs more.</p>
<p>For an interactive look at sawmill cutting, watch the video below which shows how a modern mill converts logs to lumber and the decisions made to maximise quality:</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>1) Describe one design feature you plan to add to your mirror (and why) in the Classroom discussion <strong>"My Mirror's Unique Feature"</strong>. 2) Complete the quiz on timber conversion methods ‚Äì referring to which method yields the most stable boards and which yields the most lumber per log.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 9 balances art and science: you enhance your mirror with creative touches that reflect your personal style, while also learning the scientific/logistical side of how wood gets from forest to workshop. Recognising how timber is converted enriches your appreciation for the material and can influence how you select and use wood in this and future projects.</p>
