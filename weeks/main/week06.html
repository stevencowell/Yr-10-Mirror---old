<summary><strong>Week 6: Mortise &amp; Tenon Joints (Part 2) and Other Frame Joints</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Continuing from Week 5, Week 6 will cover cutting the <strong>tenon</strong> to fit our mortise and assembling the mortise and tenon joint. We will also discuss any other joint types relevant to frame construction (for example, if someone is using a different joint for their mirror corners, such as half-lap joints, we‚Äôll address that). By the end of this week, you should have a completed sample M&amp;T joint and be ready to apply these skills to your project if needed.</p>
<h4>Cutting the Tenon</h4>
<p>With your mortise ready, the next step is to cut the tenon on the mating piece. Steps to cut an accurate tenon:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Layout:</strong> Using a marking gauge and square, mark the tenon thickness on the end of the piece (this should match the mortise width). Also mark the shoulders ‚Äì how far back the tenon extends. For example, if the mirror frame joint is at the corner, you might have a tenon that is, say, 40mm long into a stile. Mark the tenon length slightly shorter than the mortise depth (about 2-3mm shorter to avoid bottoming out).</li>
<li><strong>Saw the Cheeks:</strong> The ‚Äúcheeks‚Äù are the faces of the tenon. Use a tenon saw (or bandsaw if available) to cut down along the waste sides of the tenon cheeks, just inside the lines, from the end of the piece to the shoulder line. It‚Äôs often best to cut the two cheek cuts with the wood held vertically and the saw cutting straight down.</li>
<li><strong>Saw the Shoulders:</strong> Lay the piece flat and saw along the shoulder lines to meet the cheek cuts. The waste pieces should fall away, leaving the tenon. Make sure to keep the saw kerf on the waste side of the line to preserve the full width of the tenon.</li>
<li><strong>Trim &amp; Fit:</strong> Test the tenon in the mortise. If it‚Äôs too tight, use a sharp chisel or a shoulder plane to pare down the cheeks gently until it slides in with firm pressure. If it‚Äôs too loose (hopefully not), options include shimming it or re-cutting on a new piece if it‚Äôs excessively sloppy. Aim for a fit where the tenon can be inserted by hand and pulled out by hand, but without much wobble.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tip:</em> When test fitting, don‚Äôt force the tenon all the way in if it‚Äôs very snug and dry ‚Äì you might get it stuck. It should go in most of the way with hand pressure. Remember, glue will lubricate a tight joint slightly during assembly, but you don‚Äôt want to rely on that too much.</p>
<h4>Reinforcing and Assembling</h4>
<p>For our sample joints or if you incorporate an M&amp;T in your mirror, consider how it will be secured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, woodworking glue alone is sufficient for a well-fitted M&amp;T, creating a bond stronger than the wood itself.</li>
<li>In high-stress applications, a peg or dowel is sometimes driven through the joint (a <strong>drawbore peg</strong>) after gluing for additional mechanical lock. For the mirror frame, this is likely unnecessary and would alter the appearance.</li>
<li>Clamp the joint snugly during glue-up, ensuring the shoulder seats fully with no gap. Wipe off excess glue.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will assemble our practice M&amp;T joints in class to observe how everything comes together. Make sure to have clamps ready and protect the wood surface with scrap blocks under the clamp jaws.</p>
<h4>Other Frame Joint Options</h4>
<p>Not all mirror frames will use a mortise and tenon. Here are a couple of other joint methods some of you might be using (or might consider):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half-Lap Joint:</strong> A simple but strong corner joint where half the thickness of each piece is removed at the end so they lap over each other. This increases glue surface and keeps the frame flush. It‚Äôs simpler to cut than a mortise and tenon and can be done with saws and chisels or even a router. If anyone is pursuing a half-lap for their mirror frame, ensure the two halves fit flush and tight.</li>
<li><strong>Mitre Joint with Splines/Biscuits:</strong> Many mirror frames are just mitred at 45¬∞ on the corners for a clean look. On its own, a plain miter isn‚Äôt very strong for a wooden frame, so reinforcement like a glued spline (a thin strip inserted in slots across the joint) or biscuits can help. We covered biscuit joints in Week 4 ‚Äì those can be applied to mitred corners too.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Complete the <strong>M&amp;T Joint Quiz</strong> on Classroom (covering terminology like ‚Äúcheeks‚Äù and ‚Äúshoulders‚Äù and best practices for fitting). If you made a sample M&amp;T joint, upload a photo and brief note about how it went.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By completing the mortise and tenon joint, you‚Äôve practised one of the most important woodworking joints. Even if your mirror frame won‚Äôt explicitly use a hidden M&amp;T, the skills of careful measuring, cutting, and fitting apply to all joinery. Week 6 wraps up our intensive focus on joinery techniques ‚Äì from here, we‚Äôll start adding creative features and moving toward finishing the project.</p>
