<summary><strong>Week 4: Dowel, Biscuit &amp; Domino Joints; Timber Selection &amp; Properties</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 4 dives into <strong>joinery techniques</strong> for connecting pieces of the mirror frame. We‚Äôll compare dowel joints, biscuit joints, and the Festool Domino system ‚Äì all methods of aligning and strengthening a joint with inserted pieces. Additionally, we‚Äôll discuss how to <strong>select suitable timber</strong> for joinery by understanding timber properties.</p>
<h4>Dowel, Biscuit, and Domino Joinery</h4>
<p>These three methods all involve inserting a piece (dowel, biscuit, or domino tenon) to reinforce a joint between two boards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dowel Joints:</strong> Round wooden dowels are inserted into matching drilled holes in the two pieces. This requires precise drilling but creates a strong, hidden connection. Dowel joints typically offer greater strength than biscuits due to the larger wood cross-section and can be used for furniture and frames.</li>
<li><strong>Biscuit Joints:</strong> Thin oval-shaped biscuits (made of compressed wood) fit into slots cut by a biscuit joiner tool. When glue is applied, the biscuit swells, locking the joint. Biscuits are excellent for aligning pieces (for example, keeping frame corners flush) and are quick and easy to use. They add moderate strength but are generally not as strong as dowels for load-bearing joints.</li>
<li><strong>Domino Joints:</strong> The Domino system (by Festool) inserts a thick rectangular ‚Äúloose tenon‚Äù (like an oval hardwood block) into slots made by a specialised machine. It essentially combines the concept of a traditional mortise and tenon with the ease of a biscuit joiner. Dominos provide excellent strength (comparable to dowels) and precise alignment, but the tool is expensive and usually only found in advanced workshops. We may not use the Domino in this project, but it‚Äôs useful to know about modern joinery innovations.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding which to use for a project like a mirror frame:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biscuit joints are often sufficient for aligning the mitred corners of a frame and add some strength along with glue. We have biscuit joiners in our workshop, so this is a likely method for your mirror.</li>
<li>If you want extra strength or don‚Äôt have a biscuit joiner available, dowels can be used in the corners. You must drill very accurately (using a jig helps) to ensure the holes line up.</li>
<li>We won‚Äôt use the Domino in this project (due to tool availability), but understanding it can inspire how you approach joinery in future projects or higher-level classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a demonstration of using a biscuit joiner (the tool and technique), you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-AT5YRUwDLU" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">Dowel vs Biscuit vs Domino ‚Äì Joinery Comparison</a>. It shows how quickly biscuits can align and join boards.</p>
<h4>Timber Properties &amp; Selecting Wood for Joinery</h4>
<p>Not all wood is the same when it comes to making joints. Important timber properties to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardwood vs Softwood:</strong> Hardwoods (from deciduous trees like oak or maple) are generally denser and hold joinery well, but can be harder to cut. Softwoods (from conifers like pine) are easier to work but can strip or crush in joints if over-tightened. (Note: ‚ÄúHardwood‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftwood‚Äù refer to tree type, not necessarily wood hardness ‚Äì balsa is a hardwood botanically but very soft.) Hardwood trees grow slower and their timber is usually denser and stronger.</li>
<li><strong>Grain and Stability:</strong> Wood with straight grain and without many knots is ideal for joinery. Knots and wild grain can be weak points or cause a drill or cutter to wander. Straight-grained timber will result in stronger dowel or biscuit joints.</li>
<li><strong>Moisture Content:</strong> Properly seasoned wood (as we will cover in Week 11) is crucial. Timber that is too wet or not fully dried may shrink or warp after joinery, loosening the joints.</li>
<li><strong>Timber Strength:</strong> Different species have different strength. For example, using a very soft timber for a dowel might result in the dowel itself breaking under stress before the surrounding wood does. Typically, use the same species for dowels/biscuits as the project wood, or a harder wood for dowels if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choosing Wood for Your Mirror:</strong> Our mirror frames will likely be made from <em>pine</em> or similar softwood for affordability and ease. Pine will work fine with either biscuit or dowel joints, but take care not to overtighten clamps as pine can compress. If you have access to some hardwood (like a piece of oak or maple) for contrast or sturdiness, you can incorporate it ‚Äì just consider that hardwood may require pre-drilling for screws and more patience when cutting.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Complete the <strong>Joinery Comparison</strong> worksheet on Classroom (list one advantage and one drawback for dowel, biscuit, and domino joints). Also, in the forum, post which joinery method you plan to use for your mirror frame and why.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 4 expands your joinery toolkit and reinforces that choosing the right method and material is key to a strong project. Understanding timber properties helps in selecting good stock for your frame, and knowing multiple joinery options lets you pick what best suits your design and resources. You‚Äôre now ready to start creating joints in your mirror frame with confidence.</p>
