<summary><strong>Week 15: Chemical Safety &amp; MSDS in Finishing</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Week 15 is a lighter practical week as your project should be nearly complete. It focuses on the theory of safe handling of chemicals in the workshop, particularly those used in finishing (paints, thinners, adhesives). We will learn about Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) – now often called SDS – which provide key safety information about chemicals.</p>
<h4>Workshop Chemicals in Use</h4>
<p>Common chemicals include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wood Finishes:</strong> Often contain solvents like mineral turpentine, naphtha, or alcohol. These are flammable and can be hazardous if inhaled.</li>
<li><strong>Adhesives:</strong> PVA glue is relatively safe, but other adhesives like epoxy can be more hazardous.</li>
<li><strong>Strippers and Cleaners:</strong> Citrus-based alternatives are safer than older, toxic formulas.</li>
<li><strong>Spray Paints:</strong> Contain propellants and solvents; use with proper ventilation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Understanding MSDS/SDS</h4>
<p>An MSDS is a document that details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product identification and hazards.</li>
<li>Composition and first aid measures.</li>
<li>Firefighting and spill cleanup instructions.</li>
<li>Handling, storage, exposure controls, and disposal guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, an MSDS for an oil-based polyurethane will warn about flammability and advise wearing gloves and eye protection.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>This week, find and interpret a real MSDS. Use the provided worksheet on Classroom to answer questions about recommended PPE, storage, and first aid measures.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Understanding MSDS information is crucial for safely handling chemicals in the workshop. This knowledge is essential whether you pursue woodworking as a hobby or a career.</p>
