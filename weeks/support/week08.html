<summary><strong>Week 8: Dry Fitting &amp; Clamping; Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>At Week 8, many of your mirror frame components should be cut and ready. This week‚Äôs focus is on <strong>dry fitting and clamping</strong> your frame and understanding the importance of planning out assembly steps. We‚Äôll also introduce how to document safety for processes by using <strong>Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)</strong> and review any relevant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for tasks at hand.</p>
<h4>Dry Fitting and Clamping Techniques</h4>
<p><strong>Dry fitting</strong> means assembling your project <em>without glue</em> to check that everything fits correctly. You should always do this before the actual glue-up, especially for multi-component assemblies like a frame with multiple joints.</p>
<p>When dry fitting your mirror frame:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assemble the pieces on a flat surface. If you‚Äôve used biscuits or dowels, insert them without glue to ensure alignment.</li>
<li>Check that the frame is square. Measure the diagonals ‚Äì they should be equal if the frame is rectangular and corners are 90¬∞.</li>
<li>Identify any gaps in joints or unevenness. If something isn‚Äôt fitting, now is the time to adjust (trim a tenon, deepen a mortise, etc.) before gluing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clamping:</strong> Once satisfied with the dry fit, plan your clamping strategy for the glue-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the right number and size of clamps ready. For a rectangular frame, typically you‚Äôd use a clamp on each side or use strap clamps that wrap around the frame corners.</li>
<li>Use <strong>cauls</strong> or scrap wood pads between the clamp jaws and your frame to protect the wood and distribute pressure. This prevents denting the timber, especially soft pine.</li>
<li>Tighten clamps evenly. Alternate turns on opposite clamps so the frame closes up uniformly. Over-tightening can squeeze out too much glue or even bow the wood; aim for firm pressure that closes any gaps.</li>
<li>Verify squareness after clamping ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy for a frame to shift when clamps are applied. Adjust the clamps or use a diagonal brace if needed to keep things square.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôre not ready to glue your actual mirror frame this week, you might practise clamping on a dry fit and even do a ‚Äúmock glue-up‚Äù drill for confidence. Proper clamping is crucial for a sturdy, well-aligned final product.</p>
<h4>Work Method Statements (SWMS)</h4>
<p>A <strong>Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)</strong> is a document used to outline how to carry out work safely. It‚Äôs often required in industry for high-risk construction tasks, but we introduce it here as a good practice for planning safe project work. An SWMS typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A description of the activity or task (e.g., ‚ÄúAssembling mirror frame with glue and clamps‚Äù).</li>
<li>Identification of potential hazards (e.g., ‚Äúskin contact with glue‚Äù, ‚Äúpinched fingers in clamps‚Äù, ‚Äútripping over clamps on floor‚Äù).</li>
<li>Risk control measures for those hazards (e.g., ‚Äúwear gloves to avoid glue on skin‚Äù, ‚Äúensure clamps are secure and use proper technique to avoid pinch‚Äù, ‚Äúkeep work area clear‚Äù).</li>
</ul>
<p>In formal terms, an SWMS is a safety planning document, required especially for high-risk work. For our class, writing a brief SWMS for a process like gluing up the frame helps you think ahead about safety and efficiency. It‚Äôs like a written version of asking ‚ÄúWhat could go wrong here, and how do I prevent it?‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>Our Task:</strong> We will fill out a simplified SWMS for the mirror frame assembly. This will cover setting up clamps, using glue safely (not ingesting, cleaning spills, etc.), and any use of tools during assembly. You‚Äôll do this in small groups so you can brainstorm hazards and controls together.</p>
<h4>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</h4>
<p>By now, you have encountered various SOPs (for machines like the band saw, disc sander, router, etc.). Ensure that for any task you do this week, you revisit the relevant SOP. For example, if you use the disc sander to slightly adjust a piece, remember to follow the Disc Sander SOP (tie back hair, use the correct side of the disc, etc.). Our goal is to maintain safety standards even as the project work becomes more complex.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>On Classroom, find the <strong>SWMS Template (Frame Assembly)</strong> and fill it out for the mirror frame glue-up process, either individually or with your team. Also, complete the short reflection: ‚ÄúWhat was one issue you caught during dry fitting that you fixed before gluing?‚Äù</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Week 8 is about foresight and planning ‚Äì both in assembling your work correctly and in ensuring safety. By dry clamping your project, you ensure a smooth final assembly with no surprises. By writing an SWMS and adhering to SOPs, you cultivate a proactive safety habit that is valuable not just in class but in any workplace or project environment.</p>
