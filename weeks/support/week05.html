<summary><strong>Week 5: Mortise &amp; Tenon Joints (Part 1)</strong></summary>
<article>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Mortise and tenon joints are among the most traditional and reliable woodworking joints, often dubbed the ‚Äúking of joints‚Äù for their strength. In Weeks 5 and 6, we will learn how to create a mortise and tenon (M&amp;T) joint and explore variations or alternative joints if applicable. This week (Part 1), we focus on the basics: understanding the joint and cutting the <strong>mortise</strong>.</p>
<h4>Mortise and Tenon Basics</h4>
<p>A mortise and tenon joint connects two pieces of wood at a right angle, commonly used in frame construction (like table legs and rails, or in our case, potentially the mirror frame corners if done as bridle joints or reinforced corners). The <strong>mortise</strong> is the rectangular cavity cut into one piece, and the <strong>tenon</strong> is the corresponding tongue cut on the end of the other piece that fits into the mortise.</p>
<p>Key characteristics of a good M&amp;T joint:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tenon shoulders (the parts that sit flush against the mortised piece) should fit tightly with no gaps.</li>
<li>The tenon should fill the mortise with minimal wiggle, but not so tight that it needs to be forced (glue needs a bit of space).</li>
<li>Mortise depth is usually a bit more than the tenon length so excess glue has somewhere to go (often tenon is about 3-5mm shorter than mortise depth to avoid bottoming out).</li>
<li>Typically, the mortise width is about one-third the thickness of the workpiece.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Marking and Cutting the Mortise</h4>
<p>We will cut mortises by hand using drills and chisels (since dedicated mortising machines are limited). Steps to create a mortise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Layout:</strong> On the piece of wood that will receive the mortise (e.g., a frame stile), clearly mark the outline of the mortise. Use a square and marking gauge to ensure accuracy. For instance, if our frame pieces are 19mm thick, a common mortise might be ~6mm wide (1/3 thickness) and perhaps 30mm deep. Mark the mortise location centred on the thickness and at the appropriate distance from the end (depending on design).</li>
<li><strong>Drilling (Waste Removal):</strong> Secure the wood. Using a drill press or handheld drill with a brad-point bit of appropriate size (slightly less width than the mortise), drill a series of overlapping holes within the mortise outline. Drill to the required depth. This removes most of the waste wood.</li>
<li><strong>Chiselling:</strong> Use sharp bench chisels to square up the mortise. Start by chiselling along the ends (the cross-grain sides) of the mortise to define the edges, then work from each end toward the middle to remove remaining waste. Keep the chisel vertical and use a mallet for controlled force. Periodically test the depth and clean out chips. The result should be straight, flat mortise walls.</li>
<li><strong>Test Fit (with scrap tenon):</strong> If possible, have a scrap piece cut to the mortise width to test the fit. It should slide in with hand pressure and not wobble side-to-side.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> Precision is crucial. A mortise that is too narrow can be widened with careful paring, but one that‚Äôs too wide will make the joint sloppy. Take your time with layout and chiselling.</p>
<h4>Tools and Safety for Mortising</h4>
<p>While chopping a mortise, always keep hands behind the chisel cutting edge. Secure your workpiece with clamps or in a vice ‚Äì never hold the piece in your hand while chiselling. If using a drill, clamp the wood to prevent it spinning if the bit catches. Wear safety glasses especially during chiselling; small wood chips can fly off.</p>
<p>We are using sharp chisels; handle them with respect. When not in use, set them down with the sharp edge away from you and others.</p>
<h4>Alternative Joint Consideration</h4>
<p>If a traditional mortise and tenon seems too challenging or not suitable for your mirror frame corners, an <strong>alternative joint</strong> that might be used is a <strong>bridle joint</strong> (open mortise and tenon) or a reinforced miter (with a spline). We will primarily practise M&amp;T because it teaches transferable skills. However, keep in mind these alternatives for different project needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridle Joint:</strong> Essentially a tenon that goes through the end of the piece (open on top), like an open mortise. Easier to cut than a hidden mortise and tenon and useful for frame corners.</li>
<li><strong>Spline or Biscuit Reinforced Miter:</strong> As learnt, a biscuit or thin spline can reinforce a miter joint on a frame if M&amp;T is not used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In your workbook (or Classroom assignment), answer the questions in <strong>Mortise &amp; Tenon Part 1</strong>: Describe the steps to cut a mortise, and explain why the mortise is cut before the tenon in fitting this joint.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 5, you should have one or more mortises cut for a sample joint and a solid understanding of how and why mortise dimensions are chosen. Mastery of the mortise forms the foundation; next week, we will tackle crafting the matching tenon and assembling the joint.</p>
