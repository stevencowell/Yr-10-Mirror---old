<article>
<h4>Theory</h4>
<p>Always follow workshop safety rules. Wear safety glasses and strong shoes. Keep the workshop clean and tell your teacher if you see damaged tools. When marking timber, use a pencil and ruler or marking gauge to draw clear lines. Always measure carefully before cutting.</p>

<summary><strong>Weeks 3 &amp; 4:</strong> Timber Dressing and Simple Joints</summary>
<article>
<h4>Theory</h4>
<p>"Dressing timber" means making wood flat and smooth. A hand plane is used to remove bumps. Always plane timber in the same direction as the grain to prevent tearing the wood. Simple timber joints like dowel joints use small wooden pins to join pieces strongly.</p>

<summary><strong>Weeks 5 &amp; 6:</strong> Mortise and Tenon Joints</summary>
<article>
<h4>Theory</h4>
<p>Mortise and tenon joints are strong timber joints. A mortise is a rectangular hole, and a tenon is the piece of wood that fits into it. Always use a sharp chisel safely to cut mortises. Test fit the joint before adding glue.</p>
